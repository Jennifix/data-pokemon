# pokemon-data

In this project I've created a page that lets people compare the different types of Pokémon.

## UX

This site is created to give people who are interested in pokemon an easy way to compare the types of pokémon. The page has a very simple design.

- The user visits this page to compare the types of pokemon

- The user wants a simple design and doesn't want unnecessary steps.

## Features

- The user can easily click the graphs to get different comparisons

- The user can easy get to the graphs by clicking the button on the landing or just scrolling down the page.

## Technologies Used

- D3.js, DC, Crossfilter was used to create the interactive graphs.

- Bootstrap was used to create the layout of the page.

- Sass was used to create styles more efficiently.

## Testing

I asked a couple of friends try out the website and check out the code to find errors. They clicked around on all the buttons and everything worked. 

I've also done my own testing and ran the code on https://jshint.com/

## Deployment

The website was written using Visual Code Studio, which I also used push my project to GitHub, using Git.

This project is hosted by GitHub. I deployed it by going into the settings of the repositry and scrolled down until I found the GitHub Pages section. I then click the dropdown menu that says "None" and choose Master Branch. The page refreshes automatically and the link to the deployed site can be found in the GitHub Pages section on the same page.

To run the code locally you have to go to the repositry and download the URL shown when you click the "Clone or download" button. You then open up the terminal in your IDE and type "git clone" plus the URL and then hit enter.
