In this project I've created a page that lets people compare the different types of Pokémon.

## UX

This site is created to give people who are interested in pokemon an easy way to compare the types of pokémon. The page has a very simple design with button on the landing that brings you right to the graphs.

## Testing

I asked a couple of friends who are working as developers to try out the website and check out the code to find errors

## Deployment

The website was written using Visual Code Studio, which I also used push my project to GitHub, using Git.

This project is hosted by GitHub. I deployed it by going into the settings of the repositry and scrolled down until I found the GitHub Pages section. I then click the dropdown menu that says "None" and choose Master Branch. The page refreshes automatically and the link to the deployed site can be found in the GitHub Pages section on the same page.

To run the code locally you have to go to the repositry and download the URL shown when you click the "Clone or download" button. You then open up the terminal in your IDE and type "git clone" plus the URL and then hit enter.
